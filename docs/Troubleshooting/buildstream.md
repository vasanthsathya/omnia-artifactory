# BuildStreaM Issues

Issues related to BuildStreaM pipeline execution, GitLab integration, catalog validation, and image deployment.

## Health Check Stage Failing

???+ note "Symptom"

    Health Check stage is failing in the BuildStreaM pipeline.

??? note "Cause"

    - GitLab target IP and host IP of the BuildStreaM API server are not reachable from each other
    - BuildStreaM containers are not running properly

??? note "Resolution"

    1. Ensure the GitLab target IP and BuildStreaM API server are in the same subnet.

    2. Verify that the BuildStreaM containers and services are running on the OIM node:

        ```bash title="Run on: OIM host"
        systemctl status omnia_build_stream.service
        systemctl status omnia_postgres.service
        systemctl status playbook_watcher.service
        ```

    3. If there are failures in any of the containers, capture and verify the logs from journalctl:

        ```bash title="Run on: OIM host"
        journalctl -u omnia_build_stream --no-pager
        journalctl -u omnia_postgres --no-pager
        ```

## API Registration Stage Failing

???+ note "Symptom"

    API-Registration stage is failing in the BuildStreaM pipeline.

??? note "Cause"

    - Maximum client limit reached for BuildStreaM API server registration
    - Other API registration errors

!!! note

    Currently, only one client can be registered with the BuildStreaM API server.

??? note "Resolution"

    1. If you encounter the `max_clients_limit_reached` error:
        - Either run the pipeline from the already registered client
        - Or perform the `cleanup_gitlab` and reconfigure GitLab using the playbook

    2. For other non-successful API responses, on the OIM, check the authentication logs at `/<nfs-dir>/omnia/log/build_stream/auth.log` for detailed error information.

## Token Generation Stage Failing

???+ note "Symptom"

    Token-Generation stage is failing in the BuildStreaM pipeline.

??? note "Cause"

    - Token generation failed due to authentication issues
    - Token generation failed due to network issues

??? note "Resolution"

    On the OIM, check the authentication logs at `/<nfs-dir>/omnia/log/build_stream/auth.log` for detailed error information.

## Parse Catalog Stage Failing

???+ note "Symptom"

    Parse-Catalog stage is failing in the BuildStreaM pipeline.

??? note "Cause"

    - Invalid JSON schema format
    - The `catalog_rhel.json` structure does not match the expected catalog schema

??? note "Resolution"

    - Ensure the JSON is aligned with the schema as shown in the reference examples available at:
        - [https://github.com/dell/omnia/tree/pub/build_stream/examples/catalog](https://github.com/dell/omnia/tree/pub/build_stream/examples/catalog)
    - If the issue persists, on the OIM, check the job-specific logs at `/<nfs-dir>/omnia/log/build_stream/<job-id>/<jobid>.log`

## Create Local Repo Stage Failing

???+ note "Symptom"

    Create-Local-Repo stage is failing in the BuildStreaM pipeline.

??? note "Cause"

    - Playbook execution failed
    - Configuration issues in `local_repo_config.yml`

??? note "Resolution"

    1. If there are issues with playbook execution, the log path is available from the API response. Check the logs at the path specified in the `log_file_path` field.

        **Example API response format**:

        ```json title="Example API response format"
        {
            "stage_name": "create-local-repository",
            "stage_state": "FAILED",
            "started_at": "2026-03-11T10:07:58.906785+00:00Z",
            "ended_at": "2026-03-11T10:49:20.639894+00:00Z",
            "error_code": "PLAYBOOK_EXECUTION_FAILED",
            "error_summary": "Playbook exited with code 2",
            "log_file_path": "/nfs/omnia/log/build_stream/5a4f69f4-44df-42eb-b88b-1583ea2610a8/local_repo.yml_20260311_171630.log"
        }
        ```

    2. Verify the configuration settings in `local_repo_config.yml`.

    3. After fixing the configuration issues, re-run the pipeline.

## Build Images Stage Failing

???+ note "Symptom"

    Build Images stage is failing in the BuildStreaM pipeline.

??? note "Cause"

    - Playbook execution failed
    - Catalog does not have predefined functional groups

??? note "Resolution"

    1. Ensure the catalog has the predefined functional groups. For the supported functional groups, see the [BuildStreaM deployment guide](../GetStarted/buildstream_deployment.md).

    2. If changes are required in the catalog, make the necessary modifications to the catalog.

    3. After fixing catalog issues, re-run the pipeline.

## Deploy Images Stage Failing

???+ note "Symptom"

    Deploy Images stage is failing in the BuildStreaM pipeline.

??? note "Cause"

    - Playbook execution failed
    - The functional groups listed in the PXE mapping file do not adhere to functional groups in the `catalog_rhel.json`

??? note "Resolution"

    1. Check the log path from the API response for detailed error information.

    2. Ensure the functional groups listed in the PXE mapping file matches the functional groups defined in the `catalog_rhel.json`.

    3. After making necessary modifications to the PXE mapping, re-run the pipeline manually.

## Retry Button Not Displayed

???+ note "Symptom"

    The Retry button is not displayed for failed pipeline stages, including deploy, restart, and validate operations.

??? note "Cause"

    The Retry button may not appear in certain failed pipeline stages due to GitLab issues.

??? note "Resolution"

    1. Initiate a restart from the parent pipeline to resolve this issue.

    2. This action restarts the entire pipeline from the beginning, allowing all stages to execute again.
