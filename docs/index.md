Omnia is an open-source deployment toolkit designed to automate
the setup and management of high-performance computing (HPC) environments on
Linux-based servers. It leverages a domain-based architecture with Ansible playbooks to streamline:

- Operating system provisioning
- Driver installation and configuration
- Deployment of workload schedulers such as Slurm and Kubernetes
- Installation of optimization libraries, machine learning frameworks, and AI models
- Management of compute, storage, and networking resources

Omnia v2.3 introduces a domain-based architecture with independent, reusable domains that communicate via YAML contracts. The `omnia.sh` CLI provides a unified interface for domain execution, replacing the container-based model from v2.2.

Omnia simplifies infrastructure deployment in complex environments, enabling
faster setup and consistent configuration across systems.

The project is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/dell/omnia), where you can:

- Access the source code
- Report issues
- Ask questions
- Contribute to development

## Domain-Based Architecture

Omnia v2.3 is built on a **domain-based architecture** that organizes the system into 7 independent, reusable domains. Each domain handles a specific aspect of cluster deployment and management, communicating with other domains through standardized YAML contracts.

### The 7 Domains

| Domain | Purpose | When Used |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **repo_manager** | Manages local and external software repositories | All deployments requiring custom software packages |
| **image_build_manager** | Builds OS images for cluster nodes | All deployments requiring custom OS images |
| **discovery** | Discovers and inventories hardware resources | All deployments requiring hardware inventory |
| **orchestrator** | Provisions and configures cluster nodes | All deployments requiring node provisioning |
| **telemetry** | Collects and monitors system metrics | All deployments requiring monitoring and observability |
| **build_stream** | Automates CI/CD workflows via GitLab pipelines | Build Stream deployments requiring automation |
| **utils** | Provides utility functions and common operations | All deployments (supporting domain) |

### How Domains Work Together

Domains can be deployed independently or in combination, enabling flexible deployment scenarios:

- **Full Deployment**: All domains work together for complete cluster setup
- **Domain-Specific**: Individual domains can be used for targeted operations
- **Mixed Environments**: External systems can integrate with specific domains via contracts

The `omnia.sh` CLI provides a unified interface to execute domains in the correct order based on their dependencies. For detailed technical specifications, see the [domain contracts](Reference/domain_contracts/index.md).

!!! tip
    Think of domains as specialized teams that can work independently or collaborate through standardized contracts. This architecture enables you to deploy exactly what you need, when you need it.

## Previous Versions

*For a better understanding of what Omnia does, check out the following:*

- [1.x documentation](https://omnia-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html): supports diskful provisioning.
- [2.x documentation](https://omnia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html): supports diskless provisioning and containerized deployment.

!!! note
    Upgrade from Omnia 1.x to 2.x is not supported due to architectural changes.
