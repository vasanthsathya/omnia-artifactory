# Cluster DNS

Cluster DNS provides dynamic hostname resolution for Omnia-managed cluster nodes using CoreDNS-based DNS services instead of static `/etc/hosts` file management. This feature is part of the **orchestrator domain** and eliminates O(N) SSH-based hosts file updates during provisioning while providing automatic hostname resolution for newly inventoried nodes without requiring playbook re-runs.

!!! note

    Cluster DNS configuration and deployment is managed by the orchestrator domain. For configuration details, see [Configure Cluster DNS](../HowTo/Networking/configure_cluster_dns.md).

!!! important "Centralized DNS Upgrade"

    `dns_enabled` defaults to `true` only for fresh Omnia 2.2 installations. For upgrades from Omnia 2.1 to 2.2, `dns_enabled` must be set to `false`; enabling Cluster DNS during an upgrade is not supported.

## What Is Cluster DNS

Cluster DNS is a DNS-based hostname resolution system that leverages **coresmd**, the CoreDNS instance already deployed as part of the OpenCHAMI stack on the Omnia Infrastructure Manager (OIM) node. coresmd queries the OpenCHAMI State Manager Daemon (SMD) inventory every 30 seconds and automatically generates forward A records for all inventoried nodes.

When enabled, compute nodes resolve hostnames via DNS queries to the OIM instead of reading from local `/etc/hosts` files. This provides a single source of truth for hostname-to-IP mappings and eliminates the need for manual hosts file synchronization across the cluster.

## DNS Ownership Boundaries

### Omnia Cluster-Scoped DNS

Omnia manages and is responsible for the following DNS aspects:

**Cluster Node Resolution**

- Forward (A record) hostname resolution for all compute, Slurm controller, login, and Kubernetes nodes
- Dynamic DNS record generation from OpenCHAMI SMD inventory via coresmd
- DNS zone serving for the cluster domain (e.g., `hpc.cluster`)
- Cloud-init-based `/etc/resolv.conf` configuration on compute nodes
- Kubernetes CoreDNS ConfigMap patching to forward cluster domain queries to OIM coresmd

**Admin Network DNS Forwarding**

- coresmd forwards non-cluster DNS queries (e.g., `google.com`, `internal.company.com`) to upstream DNS servers configured in `admin_network.dns` from `input/network_spec.yml`
- This enables cluster nodes to resolve external and enterprise DNS names through the OIM

### Enterprise DNS (Site Administrator Responsibility)

The site network administrator retains responsibility for:

**Enterprise DNS Infrastructure**

- Upstream DNS server configuration and maintenance (specified in `admin_network.dns`)
- Enterprise-wide DNS zones and records (e.g., `company.com`, internal services)
- DNS security policies (DNSSEC, filtering, etc.)
- External DNS resolution for non-cluster resources

**Out-of-Band (OOB) Network DNS**

- BMC/iDRAC hostname resolution on the OOB management network
- DNS configuration for switch management interfaces
- Any DNS services running on networks outside the Omnia-managed admin network

**InfiniBand Fabric DNS**

- InfiniBand-specific hostname records (e.g., `nid001-ib.cluster.domain`)
- Subnet Manager (SM) hostname resolution
- Fabric management tool DNS integration

!!! note

    Omnia does not manage InfiniBand fabric DNS. MPI over InfiniBand uses UCX auto-detection for transport selection and does not rely on DNS for IB fabric discovery.


## Input Validation

When `dns_enabled` is set to `true` in `provision_config.yml`, Omnia performs an early input validation check during `provision.yml` execution. All hostnames in the PXE mapping file must follow the `nidxxx` NID format (e.g., `nid001`, `nid002`).

### Hostname Format Requirements (dns_enabled: true)

- All hostnames must match the pattern: `nid` followed by exactly three digits (e.g., `nid001`, `nid002`)
- Custom hostnames (e.g., `headnode`, `compute1`, `slurm-ctrl`) are **not supported** when DNS is enabled
- The validation runs before any provisioning tasks execute, providing an early and clear error message

### Validation Error

If any hostname in the PXE mapping file does not follow the NID format when `dns_enabled` is `true`, provisioning fails with the following error:

```text title="Expected output"
When dns_enabled is true in provision_config.yml, all hostnames in the PXE mapping file
must follow the NID format (e.g., nid001). Custom hostnames are not supported
with DNS enabled. Either set dns_enabled to false to use custom hostnames with /etc/hosts,
or update the hostnames to use the NID format.
Invalid hostnames: 'headnode' (row 2), 'compute1' (row 3)
```

### NID-to-CoreDNS Alignment

CoreDNS generates DNS records from SMD node IDs using the pattern `{cluster_shortname}{zero_padded_id}.{cluster_domain}` (e.g., `nid001.hpc.cluster` for node ID 1). The NID assigned in SMD is determined by the order of nodes sorted by xname in the generated `nodes.yaml`. To ensure correct DNS resolution, hostnames in the PXE mapping file should match the NID values that will be assigned based on xname sort order.

!!! warning

    If hostnames in the PXE mapping file do not match the NID values assigned by SMD (based on xname sort order), DNS resolution will return incorrect IP addresses. For example, if hostname `nid001` is assigned to a node that gets NID 2 in SMD, CoreDNS will resolve `nid001` to a different node's IP address. Ensure that the numbering in your PXE mapping file hostnames matches the expected xname sort order.

## DNS Architecture

### Legacy Behavior: /etc/hosts (dns_enabled: false)

When `dns_enabled` is set to `false`, Omnia uses static `/etc/hosts` file management. All hostnames (NID-based or custom) are supported in this mode:

**At Boot (Cloud-Init)**

- Cloud-init renders the `ip_name_map` dictionary (hostname-to-IP mapping for all cluster nodes) into `/etc/hosts` as append entries
- The mapping is a snapshot at provisioning time and does not update if nodes are added or removed later

**OIM /etc/hosts Update**

- During `provision.yml` execution, the `update_hosts.yml` task iterates through every entry in the PXE mapping file
- Removes stale entries and adds fresh `<ADMIN_IP> <HOSTNAME>` lines
- This is an O(N) shell loop that takes several minutes for large clusters

**Slurm Node /etc/hosts Update**

- The `update_hosts_munge.yml` task SSHes into each reachable Slurm node
- Removes stale entries and adds fresh `<IP> <hostname>` entries for all current nodes
- This is an O(N x M) operation (N nodes visited, M lineinfile operations per node)

**Limitations**

- New nodes added after boot are not resolvable until the node is reprovisioned or the playbook re-pushes `/etc/hosts`
- Removed nodes leave stale entries until the next playbook run
- Inconsistent `/etc/hosts` across the cluster due to race conditions or unreachable nodes

### CoreDNS Behavior (dns_enabled: true)

By default, `dns_enabled` is `true` for fresh Omnia 2.2 installations. Omnia uses dynamic DNS resolution, and all hostnames must follow the NID format (validated during provisioning):

**At Boot (Cloud-Init)**

- Cloud-init writes `/etc/resolv.conf` with the OIM IP as the nameserver and the cluster domain as the search domain
- Does not append any peer entries to `/etc/hosts`
- The `search <domain_name>` directive enables short-name resolution (e.g., `nid001` resolves as `nid001.hpc.cluster`)
- All hostname resolution is handled by CoreDNS via coresmd

**OIM /etc/hosts Update — Skipped**

- The `update_hosts.yml` task detects `dns_enabled: true` and skips the entire `/etc/hosts` update block
- Only the localhost entry is ensured

**Slurm Node /etc/hosts Update — Skipped**

- The `update_hosts_munge.yml` task detects `dns_enabled: true` and skips the entire SSH-based `/etc/hosts` management block
- Munge key distribution and Slurm service restart logic continue to function normally

**Firewall Configuration**

- Port 53 (TCP and UDP) is opened on the OIM node firewall unconditionally during OpenCHAMI deployment
- This ensures CoreDNS is reachable from all compute nodes regardless of when `dns_enabled` is configured

### Behavior Summary

| dns_enabled | Hostnames | Behavior |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| `true` (default) | `nidxxx` format (`nid001`–`nid999`) | Validation passes. `/etc/resolv.conf` points to CoreDNS. `/etc/hosts` is not populated with peer entries. All resolution via DNS. |
| `true` | Any non-NID (`headnode`, `compute1`) | Validation fails with error message. Provisioning stops. User must fix hostnames or set `dns_enabled` to `false`. |
| `false` | Any format | `/etc/hosts` populated with all hostnames. `/etc/resolv.conf` is not modified. Standard `/etc/hosts`-based resolution. |

### DNS Resolution Flow

![DNS resolution flow](../assets/images/cluster-dns-resolution-flow.svg)

**coresmd Record Generation**

- Every 30 seconds, coresmd queries SMD for the current node inventory
- For each node, it creates a record: `{cluster_shortname}{zero_padded_id}.{cluster_domain} -> <admin_ip>`
- Example: Node ID 1 with `cluster_shortname=nid`, `cluster_nidlength=3`, `cluster_domain=hpc.cluster` produces: `nid001.hpc.cluster -> 172.16.0.1`
- Non-cluster queries are forwarded to upstream DNS servers from `admin_network.dns`




## High Availability Behavior

### Current Implementation

**Single coresmd Instance**

- coresmd runs as a single container on the OIM node
- No VIP failover or load balancing is currently implemented
- If the OIM node or coresmd container is down, DNS queries from compute nodes fail

**Failure Mode**

- DNS queries time out after 1 second (`options timeout:1`), retry once (`options attempts:2`), then fail
- All hostname resolution fails until coresmd is restored
- Slurm jobs cannot start; running MPI jobs that need to resolve new peers will fail
- Already-connected TCP sessions (e.g., active MPI communications) continue until a new resolution is needed

**Mitigation**

- Restart coresmd container on the OIM node
- Future HA enhancement will provide VIP failover (deferred to OIM HA specification)

!!! warning

    In the current implementation, the OIM node is a single point of failure for DNS resolution. For production deployments requiring high availability, ensure the OIM node is deployed with appropriate redundancy and monitoring.


## Fabric-Aware Resolution

### Ethernet (Admin/PXE Network)

**Supported Resolution**

- coresmd returns the admin/PXE IP address for each node from SMD
- This is the IP address used for Slurm hostname resolution and cluster management
- MPI over Ethernet uses this IP for peer discovery

**Record Format**

- Forward A records only: `nid001.hpc.cluster -> 172.16.0.1`
- No reverse DNS (PTR) records are generated
- No fabric-specific suffixes (e.g., `-ib`) are supported

### InfiniBand Fabric

**Not Supported**

- coresmd does not generate InfiniBand-specific DNS records
- No `nid001-ib.hpc.cluster` records are available
- Reverse DNS for IB addresses is not provided

**MPI Behavior**

- MPI implementations typically use UCX auto-detection for InfiniBand transport selection
- UCX discovers IB interfaces directly via the RDMA/Verbs API, not via DNS
- Explicit IB DNS records are rarely required for MPI job execution

**Workaround**

- If your MPI implementation requires IB-specific hostnames, configure them manually in `/etc/hosts` on the relevant nodes
- This is a site-specific configuration outside of Omnia's automated management


## Interaction with admin_network.dns

### Upstream DNS Forwarding

**Configuration**

- Upstream DNS servers are specified in `input/network_spec.yml` under `admin_network.dns`
- These servers are used by coresmd to forward non-cluster DNS queries

**Query Flow**

![Upstream DNS query flow](../assets/images/cluster-dns-upstream-forwarding-flow.svg)

**Use Cases**

- Cluster nodes need to resolve external services (e.g., package repositories, authentication servers)
- Cluster nodes need to resolve internal enterprise services outside the cluster domain
- Kubernetes pods need to resolve external APIs

**Configuration Example**

```yaml title="File: input/network_spec.yml"
Networks:
- admin_network:
    dns:
      - 8.8.8.8
      - 8.8.4.4
```

!!! note

    The `admin_network.dns` configuration is used by both coresmd and Kubernetes CoreDNS for external resolution.

## Interaction with Kubernetes CoreDNS

### K8s CoreDNS ConfigMap Patching

**When DNS is Enabled**

- The first Kubernetes control plane node's cloud-init script patches the K8s CoreDNS ConfigMap
- Adds a forward zone block: `<domain_name>:53 { errors; cache 30; forward . <admin_nic_ip> }`
- The patch is idempotent: if the zone already exists, it is not added again
- After patching, the K8s CoreDNS deployment is restarted via `kubectl rollout restart`

**Pod Resolution Flow**

![Pod resolution flow](../assets/images/cluster-dns-kubernetes-forwarding-flow.svg)

**Verification**

After patching, K8s pods can resolve compute node hostnames:

```bash title="Run on: K8s control plane node"
kubectl exec -it <pod> -- getent hosts nid001.hpc.cluster
```

**Use Case**

- Enables MPI-over-Kubernetes workloads to resolve Slurm/compute hostnames from within pods
- Allows host-network pods and jobs to resolve compute node hostnames

## Operational Expectations

### Resolution Latency

**Cached Queries**

- DNS queries are served from coresmd's in-memory cache (30s TTL)
- Cached lookup latency: < 1 millisecond
- Sub-millisecond response times for cached lookups

**Cache Refresh**

- coresmd queries SMD every 30 seconds to refresh its inventory cache
- New nodes added to SMD are resolvable within 30 seconds of registration
- Removed nodes stop resolving after the next cache refresh (up to 30 seconds)

**Uncached Queries**

- First lookup for a new node requires coresmd to query SMD
- Latency depends on SMD API response time (typically < 100ms)

### Node Lifecycle Behavior

**Node Add**

1. Register node in SMD via discovery playbook
2. coresmd picks it up within 30s (next cache refresh)
3. slurmctld can resolve it via DNS
4. Node transitions to IDLE state
5. No playbook re-run needed for DNS resolution

**Node Remove**

1. Remove node from SMD
2. coresmd drops the record within 30s (next cache refresh)
3. slurmctld marks node as DOWN
4. No `/etc/hosts` cleanup needed

**Node Reprovision**

- Changing `dns_enabled` requires node reprovisioning (reboot into cloud-init)
- Cloud-init writes the appropriate resolver configuration (`/etc/resolv.conf` or `/etc/hosts`)
- This is a deployment-time decision, not expected to change frequently

## Common Failure Scenarios

### coresmd Unreachable

**Scenario** — OIM node is down or coresmd container is stopped

**Behavior**

- DNS queries from compute nodes time out after 1 second (`options timeout:1`)
- Queries retry once (`options attempts:2`), then fail
- All hostname resolution fails until coresmd is restored

**Impact**

- Slurm jobs cannot start
- Running MPI jobs that need to resolve new peers will fail
- Already-connected TCP sessions continue until a new resolution is needed

**Mitigation**

- Restart coresmd container: `podman restart coresmd-coredns`
- Monitor coresmd health via Prometheus metrics on port 9153
- Future HA enhancement will provide VIP failover

### SMD Unreachable from coresmd

**Scenario** — SMD API is down but coresmd is running

**Behavior**

- coresmd continues serving records from its last cached SMD query (up to 30s stale)
- New nodes added during the outage are not resolvable until SMD recovers and coresmd refreshes its cache

**Impact**

- Existing nodes continue to resolve (stale data)
- New nodes cannot be resolved until SMD recovery

**Mitigation**

- Restart SMD service
- Monitor SMD health and connectivity

### Node Not in SMD

**Scenario** — A node is provisioned but not registered in SMD

**Behavior**

- coresmd has no record for the node
- DNS queries for its hostname return NXDOMAIN
- Slurm marks the node as DOWN

**Mitigation**

- Ensure discovery playbook has been run to register the node in SMD
- Verify SMD inventory: `curl -k https://<oim_ip>:8443/v1/nodes`

### Domain Misconfiguration

**Scenario** — `domain_name` in OIM metadata does not match the zone configured in coresmd Corefile

**Behavior**

- Compute nodes search for `<hostname>.<wrong_domain>` which coresmd does not serve
- Resolution fails with NXDOMAIN

**Mitigation**

- `domain_name` is set once during `prepare_oim.yml` and used consistently across all templates
- User does not configure the domain separately
- Verify OIM metadata if resolution fails

### Upstream DNS Failure

**Scenario** — All upstream DNS servers specified in `admin_network.dns` are unreachable

**Behavior**

- Non-cluster DNS queries (e.g., `google.com`) fail
- Cluster internal resolution (e.g., `nid001.hpc.cluster`) continues to work

**Impact**

- Cluster nodes cannot resolve external services
- Package repositories, authentication servers, and external APIs may be unreachable

**Mitigation**

- Ensure at least two reliable upstream DNS servers are configured
- Monitor upstream DNS server availability
- Use local caching DNS servers if external connectivity is unreliable

### Firewall Blocking DNS Port

**Scenario** — Firewall on the OIM node blocks UDP/TCP port 53

**Behavior**

- Compute nodes cannot reach CoreDNS
- DNS queries time out; all hostname resolution fails
- SSH between nodes fails if hostnames are used

**Mitigation**

- Port 53 is opened unconditionally during OpenCHAMI deployment via the `firewall.yml` task
- If port 53 is not open, manually open it:

```bash title="Run on: OIM host"
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=53/udp --add-port=53/tcp && firewall-cmd --reload
```

- Verify port is open: `firewall-cmd --list-ports`

## Use Cases

**Large-Scale Clusters (100+ Nodes)**

- Eliminates O(N x M) SSH operations for `/etc/hosts` management
- Reduces provisioning time significantly
- Provides consistent hostname resolution across the cluster

**Dynamic Node Environments**

- New nodes are automatically resolvable within 30 seconds
- No playbook re-run needed for DNS updates
- Ideal for environments with frequent node additions/removals

**MPI-Over-Kubernetes Workloads**

- K8s pods can resolve compute node hostnames via CoreDNS forwarding
- Enables hybrid Slurm/Kubernetes deployments
- Supports containerized MPI workloads

**Sites with Strict Network Policies**

- Eliminates SSH access requirement for `/etc/hosts` management
- Reduces attack surface by removing SSH-based configuration pushes
- DNS queries use UDP/TCP port 53 only

## Verifying Hostname Resolution

### Query DNS Only (Bypasses /etc/hosts)

To verify CoreDNS resolution directly without checking `/etc/hosts`:

```bash title="Run on: OIM host"
dig <hostname>.<domain> @<admin_nic_ip>
```

Replace `<hostname>` with a cluster node hostname (e.g., `nid001`), `<domain>` with your cluster domain, and `<admin_nic_ip>` with the OIM admin IP.

Expected output includes an ANSWER SECTION with the node's IP address:

```text title="Expected output"
;; ANSWER SECTION:
nid001.hpc.cluster.     60      IN      A       172.17.0.248
```

### Query Using Full System Resolution Order

To verify resolution using the system's configured order (`/etc/hosts` first, then DNS):

```bash title="Run on: OIM host"
getent ahosts <hostname>.<domain>
```

This follows the system's configured resolution order. If the name is in `/etc/hosts`, it returns that entry. Otherwise, it queries DNS.

### Verify All Nodes Resolve

To verify all NID hostnames resolve correctly via CoreDNS:

```bash title="Run on: OIM host"
for i in $(seq -w 1 <num_nodes>); do \
  echo -n "nid0${i}: "; \
  dig +short nid0${i}.<domain> @<admin_nic_ip>; \
done
```

## resolv.conf Configuration

When `dns_enabled: true`, Omnia configures `/etc/resolv.conf` on both the OIM host and `omnia_core` to use CoreDNS as the primary nameserver:

```text title="Example: /etc/resolv.conf"
search <domain_name> <existing-search-domains>
nameserver <cluster_boot_ip>
nameserver <existing-nameservers>
```

- `search <domain_name>` — Allows short hostnames (e.g., `nid001`) to resolve as FQDNs (`nid001.hpc.cluster`)
- `nameserver <cluster_boot_ip>` — CoreDNS listening on the cluster boot IP
- Existing nameservers are preserved as fallback for external DNS queries

!!! note

    The `resolv.conf` is protected with the immutable attribute (`chattr +i`) on the OIM host to prevent NetworkManager from overwriting it.
