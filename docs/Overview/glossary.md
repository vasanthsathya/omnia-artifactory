# Glossary

This glossary defines key terms used throughout the Omnia documentation. Terms
are listed alphabetically. Where applicable, entries link to the documentation
page that provides a full explanation.

**Apptainer**
:   Formerly known as Singularity. A container runtime designed for HPC environments that allows users to run containers without root privileges. Supported on Slurm compute nodes in Omnia 2.1+.

**Catalog**
:   A YAML manifest that defines a deployment workflow in BuildStreaM. The catalog specifies which domains to execute, in what order, and with what configuration. Administrators can create different catalogs for different deployment scenarios (e.g., Slurm-only, full deployment, BuildStreaM automation). See [BuildStreaM](build_stream/index.md).

**Domain**
:   An independent, reusable component in Omnia's domain-based architecture. Each domain handles a specific aspect of cluster deployment (e.g., repo_manager for software repositories, orchestrator for node provisioning). Domains communicate with each other through standardized YAML contracts, enabling flexible deployment scenarios. The 7 domains are: repo_manager, image_build_manager, discovery, orchestrator, telemetry, build_stream, and utils. See [Domain-Based Architecture](../index.md#domain-based-architecture).

**BMC**
:   Baseboard Management Controller. A dedicated microcontroller embedded in server motherboards that provides out-of-band management capabilities (power control, hardware monitoring, remote console) independent of the host operating system. On Dell PowerEdge servers, the BMC is implemented as **iDRAC**.

**BSS**
:   Boot Script Service. A component of **OpenCHAMI** that dynamically generates per-node boot scripts based on the node's hardware profile and assigned role. BSS provides boot configuration during network provisioning.

**BuildStreaM**
