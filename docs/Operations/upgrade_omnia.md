# Upgrade Omnia

Omnia supports in-place upgrades from version 2.1.0.0 to 2.2.0.0. The upgrade
process is a three-phase workflow: core container upgrade, prepare, and execute.
Each component is upgraded in a defined order with lock-based safety and manifest
tracking for idempotent reruns.

!!! important

    - Upgrades must be initiated from the OIM host using `omnia.sh --upgrade`
      before entering the `omnia_core` container.
    - The upgrade orchestrator must be invoked from the parent directory
      containing `upgrade/` folders.

## Supported Upgrade Paths

| Source Version | Target Version |
| --- | --- |
| Omnia 2.1.0.0 | Omnia 2.2.0.0 |

!!! note

    Direct upgrades across multiple major versions (e.g., 2.0 to 2.2) are not
    supported. Upgrade one version at a time.

!!! warning

    Upgrades from release candidate (RC) tags to major versions are not supported. Only upgrades from stable release versions are supported.

## Upgrade Considerations

Omnia 2.2.0.0 introduces significant platform enhancements, including architectural improvements and updated networking capabilities. During the upgrade from Omnia 2.1.0.0, existing configurations are preserved wherever possible while enabling the latest platform capabilities. The following table summarizes the expected upgrade behavior and key considerations.

!!! tip

    If your deployment requires all Omnia 2.2 features and deployment options immediately after installation, including capabilities that are not available as part of the upgrade process, consider performing a fresh installation of Omnia 2.2.

| **Functionality** | **Upgrade Behavior and Considerations** |
|----------|------------------------------------------|
| **Discovery** | During the upgrade, node IP addresses must be populated in the PXE mapping file by using the correlation logic. After the cluster upgrade completes successfully, node addition and deletion operations continue to work with the upgraded configuration. OME-based discovery is supported only for new Omnia 2.2 cluster deployments. OME-based discovery is not supported during upgrades from Omnia 2.1 to Omnia 2.2. |
| **Flat Network to Multi-Network Migration** | Existing flat network configurations are preserved during the upgrade. Clusters using a single PXE network and the switch gateway as the default route continue to operate with the existing network configuration after the upgrade. The upgrade process does not convert or migrate flat network configurations to multi-network configurations. |
| **Default Route Configuration** | For existing flat network clusters, the Omnia PXE network remains the default route after the upgrade. The upgrade process does not switch the default route to the switch gateway. |
| **InfiniBand (IB) Network** | For Slurm clusters, the existing InfiniBand (IB) network configuration and IB IP address assignments are preserved during the upgrade. The PXE mapping file is updated to support the IB configuration. After the upgrade, node addition and deletion operations continue to use the IP assignments defined in the PXE mapping file. |
| **Centralized DNS** | For upgrades from Omnia 2.1 to 2.2, `dns_enabled` must be set to `false`. `dns_enabled: true` is supported only for fresh Omnia 2.2 installations. For Slurm clusters, DNS server IP addresses can be updated on all nodes when DNS changes are managed through the prepare-oim process. For Kubernetes clusters, live upgrades continue to use the /etc/hosts file-based name resolution approach. Centralized DNS is not supported for Kubernetes live upgrades. |
| **Storage Provisioner** | Existing storage provisioner configurations are preserved during the upgrade. For Kubernetes service clusters, the upgrade process does not automatically migrate the storage provisioner from NFS to CSI PowerScale. |
| **VAST Mounts** | VAST mount support is introduced in Omnia 2.2 for Slurm clusters. Additional mounts for supported storage backends can be configured through storage_config.yml for both upgraded and fresh Omnia 2.2 deployments when the appropriate profiles are configured. Existing storage mount configurations and backend assignments are preserved during upgrade. The upgrade process does not automatically migrate existing mounts to VAST or to any other storage backend because of storage compatibility considerations. |
| **ETCD Data** | For Kubernetes controlplane, existing etcd storage configurations are preserved during the upgrade. The upgrade process does not migrate etcd data from NFS to local disk. |
| **Node Management** | The cluster configuration remains unchanged during the upgrade. Slurm node addition and deletion operations are not supported while the upgrade is in progress. After the upgrade completes successfully, Slurm node addition and deletion operations continue to work with the upgraded configuration. |
| **Telemetry** | PowerScale, VAST, VictoriaLogs, and UFM telemetry components are deployed by default during the upgrade and can be controlled through telemetry_config.yml. Temporary telemetry downtime is expected during the upgrade. |
| **GPU Support** | GPU support is available for Slurm compute nodes with GPUs. DCGM can be enabled on these nodes. Slurm login nodes include the CUDA toolkit, while GPU-enabled Slurm compute nodes include the CUDA driver, CUDA toolkit, and DCGM. |
| **HPC Tools** | HPC tools are supported on Slurm login and compiler nodes. For upgraded clusters, download the tools supported in Omnia 2.2 and organize using the recommended directory structure to ensure proper separation of tool packages. |
| **Rollback** | After a successful upgrade, the upgraded environment is considered the recommended operating state. Rollback is disabled by default. If post-upgrade validation identifies issues, rollback can be forced by setting -e force_rollback=true. For more information, see the [Rollback Omnia](rollback_omnia.md) section. |
| **Supported Upgrade Path** | Omnia supports upgrades only from the immediately preceding release. Omnia 2.2 supports direct upgrades from Omnia 2.1 only. Direct upgrades across multiple major versions, such as Omnia 2.0 to Omnia 2.2, are not supported. |
| **Component Upgrades** | All components are expected to upgrade successfully during the upgrade process. If a component, such as Kubernetes or Slurm, requires manual intervention, follow the documented upgrade steps for that component before continuing the upgrade workflow. Rollback is supported only for the affected component and only when the component upgrade fails because of unavoidable limitations. |

## Prerequisites

Before starting the upgrade, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. The OIM node is running and accessible.
2. The `omnia_core` container is running and the cluster is currently on
   Omnia 2.1.0.0.
3. All compute nodes are in a healthy state.
4. No other upgrade or rollback is currently in progress.
5. `oim_metadata.yml` at `/opt/omnia/.data/oim_metadata.yml` contains the
   correct current version information.
6. The target Omnia 2.2.0.0 core container image (`omnia_core:2.2`) is
   available locally on the OIM host. If it is not already available, build it
   as described in
   [Build the Omnia 2.2.0.0 Core Container Image](#build-the-omnia-2200-core-container-image).
7. **aarch64 clusters only**: If the PXE mapping file contains aarch64
   functional groups, an inventory file with an `[admin_aarch64]` group is
   required. This group must contain exactly one ARM admin node.
8. **External NFS share (if applicable)**: If using an external NFS share
   (for example, Dell PowerScale or a generic NFS server), ensure the NFS server is
   configured with a minimum of 64 NFS daemon threads and that the OIM host has
   low-latency connectivity to the NFS server. For details, see
   [Upgrade Gets Stuck at omnia.sh --upgrade with External NFS](../Troubleshooting/known_limitations.md#upgrade-gets-stuck-at-omniash-upgrade-with-external-nfs).
9. **Slurm clusters only**: Verify the current Slurm version on Slurm nodes to
   ensure compatibility with the upgrade:

    ```bash title="Run on: slurm_control_node"
    slurmctld --version
    # Expected output: slurm 25.05.2
    ```

    ```bash title="Run on: slurm_node"
    slurmd --version
    # Expected output: slurm 25.05.2
    ```

    If the Slurm version is not 25.05.2, apply the Slurm version pinning
    workaround before proceeding with the upgrade.

### Build the Omnia 2.2.0.0 Core Container Image

The upgrade swaps the running `omnia_core` container to the 2.2.0.0 image.
This image must be present on the OIM host before you run
`omnia.sh --upgrade`. To build it:

1. On the OIM host, clone the Omnia containers repository on the
   `omnia-container-v2.2.0.0` branch:

    ```bash title="Run on: OIM host"
    git clone -b omnia-container-v2.2.0.0 https://github.com/dell/omnia-containers.git
    ```

2. Build the core container image using the build script provided in the
   repository:

    ```bash title="Run on: OIM host"
    cd omnia-containers
    ./build_images.sh core core_tag=2.2 omnia_branch=v2.2.0.0
    ```

3. Confirm the image is available locally before proceeding:

    ```bash title="Run on: OIM host"
    podman images | grep omnia_core
    ```

!!! note

    Ensure the OIM host has stable internet connectivity and sufficient disk
    space while building the container image.

## Phase 0: Core Container Upgrade (OIM Host)

The upgrade begins on the OIM host outside the `omnia_core` container.

!!! important

    **Use the Omnia 2.2.0.0 `omnia.sh` script for upgrade operations.**
    The `omnia.sh` script from Omnia 2.1.0.0 does not support correct upgrade
    or rollback operations. You must download and use the Omnia 2.2.0.0 version
    of `omnia.sh` to perform upgrades and rollbacks. Do not attempt to run
    `./omnia.sh --upgrade` or `./omnia.sh --rollback` using the 2.1.0.0 script.

1. Download the Omnia 2.2.0.0 `omnia.sh` script from the Omnia repository:

    ```bash title="Run on: OIM host"
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dell/omnia/refs/tags/v2.2.0.0/omnia.sh
    ```

2. Set executable permissions:

    ```bash title="Run on: OIM host"
    chmod +x omnia.sh
    ```

3. Verify the script version (optional):

    ```bash title="Run on: OIM host"
    ./omnia.sh --version
    ```

4. Run the core container upgrade command:

    ```bash title="Run on: OIM host"
    sudo ./omnia.sh --upgrade
    ```

5. The script performs the following:

    - Detects current version from `oim_metadata.yml`
    - Shows available upgrade targets
    - Validates version and image availability
    - Requests user approval
    - Creates backup of:
        - Input configuration files (`/opt/omnia/input/`)
        - Metadata files (`oim_metadata.yml`)
        - OpenCHAMI data (PostgreSQL database dump, container environment
          variables)
        - OpenCHAMI quadlet files (`/etc/containers/systemd/`)
        - OpenCHAMI configuration files (`/etc/openchami/`)
        - Cloud-init data (groups, defaults, hostname mappings)
    - Swaps or restarts the `omnia_core` container to the 2.2 image
    - Creates upgrade guard lock at
      `/opt/omnia/.data/upgrade_in_progress.lock`
    - Seeds new input defaults
    - Displays post-upgrade instructions

6. After the container swap completes, SSH into the new `omnia_core` container
   to proceed with input preparation and component upgrades.

### Upgrade Component Order

The upgrade orchestrator processes components in the following fixed order:

| Order | Component | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `oim` | Omnia Infrastructure Manager (includes OpenCHAMI) |
| 2 | `build_stream` | BuildStreaM enablement / upgrade (terminal gate) |
| 3 | `local_repo` | Local repository staging |
| 4 | `build_image` | Compute image rebuild |
| 5 | `provision` | Cloud-Init and BSS configuration generation |
| 6 | `k8s` | Kubernetes cluster upgrade |
| 7 | `telemetry` | Telemetry component upgrade |
| 8 | `slurm` | Slurm cluster upgrade |

### Safety Mechanisms

The upgrade is designed to be safe to rerun and to fail cleanly:

- **Validation before changes** — All validation checks (version, locks,
  existing upgrade state) run before any change is made to the cluster. If a
  check fails, the upgrade stops without leaving the system in a locked state.
- **Automatic lock cleanup** — If a component fails partway, the upgrade lock
  is still released at the end of the run so you can investigate and rerun
  without manually clearing locks.
- **Idempotent reruns** — Already-completed components are skipped
  automatically when you rerun the upgrade, so only pending or failed
  components are processed.

## Phase 1: Prepare Upgrade

The `prepare_upgrade.yml` playbook transforms input files from the source
version format to the target version format, restores credentials from backup,
and presents a summary for user review.

1. SSH into the OIM node and enter the `omnia_core` container:

    ```bash title="Run on: OIM host"
    ssh omnia_core
    ```

2. Run the prepare upgrade playbook:

    ```bash title="Run on: omnia_core container"
    cd /omnia/upgrade
    ansible-playbook prepare_upgrade.yml
    ```

3. Review the output summary. The playbook identifies:

    - **Automatically migrated files** — copied as-is (e.g.,
      `provision_config.yml`, `omnia_config.yml`).
    - **Files requiring review** — new parameters added in the target version
      (e.g., `network_spec.yml`, `telemetry_config.yml`).

4. Update any new or changed parameters in
   `/opt/omnia/input/project_default/` as needed.

!!! warning

    **Do not re-run `prepare_upgrade.yml` after making input changes.**
    Re-running `prepare_upgrade.yml` after you have modified input files will
    overwrite your changes and revert to the original 2.1 inputs. Only run
    `prepare_upgrade.yml` once at the beginning of the upgrade process. After
    reviewing and updating the migrated inputs, proceed directly to the execute
    phase.

### Lock Management

The upgrade orchestrator uses lock files to prevent concurrent operations:

- `/opt/omnia/.data/upgrade_in_progress.lock` — Created at the start of the
  upgrade. Removed only on successful completion.
- `/opt/omnia/.data/rollback_in_progress.lock` — If this lock exists, the
  upgrade aborts with an error. A rollback must complete (or the lock must be
  manually removed) before an upgrade can proceed.

!!! note

    The `omnia.sh --upgrade` wrapper may pre-create the upgrade lock. The
    playbook detects this and proceeds normally without failing.

### Manifest Tracking

The upgrade state is tracked in `/opt/omnia/.data/upgrade_manifest.yml`. This
manifest records:

- `upgrade_id` — Unique identifier for this upgrade run.
- `source_version` — The version being upgraded from (derived from
  `oim_metadata.yml`).
- `target_version` — The version being upgraded to.
- `upgrade_status` — Overall status: `in-progress` or `completed`.
- `component_status` — Per-component status: `pending`, `in-progress`,
  `completed`, `skipped`, or `failed`.

On rerun, already-completed components are automatically skipped. This ensures
idempotent execution — you can safely rerun the upgrade after fixing a failed
component.

### BuildStreaM Upgrade

When `enable_build_stream=true` in `build_stream_config.yml`, the BuildStreaM
terminal gate activates. If BuildStreaM is enabled during the upgrade, the
downstream components (`local_repo`, `build_image`, `provision`, `k8s`,
`telemetry`, `slurm`) will not be upgraded by Omnia — they are managed by the
GitLab CI/CD pipeline instead. In this scenario, these components are
automatically skipped during upgrade because they are handled by the
BuildStreaM pipeline. Only `oim` and `build_stream` are actually upgraded by
Omnia.

### BuildStreaM Terminal Gate (Upgrade)

Components that are skipped are recorded as `skipped` in the upgrade manifest,
which is treated as a successful terminal state when the overall upgrade status
is determined.

The upgrade playbook determines the BuildStreaM path based on the state in
2.1:

**PATH A: BuildStreaM was ENABLED in 2.1 (upgrade path)**

- Upgrade BuildStreaM container image (quadlet update)
- PostgreSQL data migration (pg_dump → restore to new schema)
- Update GitLab configuration (URLs, runner tokens, registry)
- Upgrades the GitLab project repository (pipelines, omnia input files, catalog
  examples) by adding a new upgrade commit
- Validate BuildStreaM container + GitLab healthy

**PATH B: BuildStreaM was DISABLED in 2.1, ENABLED in 2.2 (fresh install)**

- NFS share cleanup: remove stale K8s and Slurm NFS share data
- Fresh install: PostgreSQL container (new instance)
- Fresh install: BuildStreaM container
- Fresh install: GitLab container + runner registration
- Validate all three containers healthy

!!! note

    NFS share cleanup is not automatic — the playbook displays guidance and
    prompts the operator to confirm manual cleanup before proceeding. The
    playbook verifies that NFS share directories are empty or absent after
    operator confirmation.

After the `build_stream` component completes, the following downstream
components are automatically skipped:

- `local_repo`
- `build_image`
- `provision`
- `k8s`
- `telemetry`
- `slurm`

These components are managed by the GitLab CI/CD pipeline instead. The user
must trigger the GitLab pipeline manually after upgrade completes. The GitLab
pipeline always performs a fresh install — no incremental/delta builds are
supported.

!!! note

    When `enable_build_stream=false`, the `build_stream` component is marked
    `skipped` in the manifest instead of being left as `pending`.

## Kubernetes Upgrade

!!! note

    The Kubernetes upgrade is automatically executed as part of
    [Phase 2: Execute Upgrade](#phase-2-execute-upgrade). The upgrade
    orchestrator processes the `k8s` component in the correct order (after
    `provision` and before `telemetry`) and handles all validation and status
    tracking automatically.

Kubernetes upgrade provides a robust, resumable, and transparent upgrade
process for Kubernetes clusters.

**Pre-Upgrade Checklist for Kubernetes Clusters**

Before initiating the Kubernetes upgrade, verify the following conditions are
met:

1. **All nodes Ready** — All nodes in `Ready` state, no `NotReady`.
2. **All kube-system pods Running** — No `CrashLoopBackOff`, `Pending`, or
   `Error` pods.
3. **etcd cluster healthy** — Cluster should report all members healthy.
4. **All PVCs Bound** — No PVCs in `Lost` or `Pending` state.
5. **No PVs in Failed state** — No PVs in `Failed` state.
6. **All nodes from PXE mapping are part of the cluster** — Every node defined
   in `pxe_mapping_file.csv` under `service_kube_control_plane_*` and
   `service_kube_node_*` must appear in `kubectl get nodes`.
7. **NFS mount accessible** — The shared NFS storage mount must be reachable
   from all cluster nodes.
8. **API server reachable via kube_vip** — `kubectl cluster-info` works
   through the HA virtual IP.
9. **`.cluster_initialized` marker exists on all control planes** —
   `/etc/kubernetes/.cluster_initialized` must be present on every CP node
   (confirms provisioning completed).

**Kubernetes Upgrade Workflow**

The K8s upgrade follows this sequence:

1. **Pre-checks** — Validates `service_k8s` configuration and prerequisites.
2. **Version Detection** — Detects current K8s version across all nodes.
3. **Hop Chain Calculation** — Determines hop chain for upgrade.
4. **Backup Phase** — Backs up etcd and K8s configurations.
5. **Repository Setup** — Configures package repositories on all nodes.
6. **First Control Plane Upgrade** — Upgrades the first control plane node.
7. **BSS/Cloud-init Update for First Control Plane** — Updates boot
   configuration and reboots first control plane.
8. **Additional Control Planes Upgrade** — Upgrades remaining control plane
   nodes sequentially.
9. **BSS/Cloud-init Update for Additional Control Planes** — Updates boot
   configuration (no reboot).
10. **Addon Upgrade** — Upgrades Calico, MetalLB, Helm, and PowerScale CSI
    driver (if PowerScale is configured).
11. **First Worker Upgrade** — Upgrades the first worker node.
12. **BSS/Cloud-init Update for All Workers** — Updates boot configuration for
    all workers and reboots first worker.
13. **Remaining Workers Upgrade** — Upgrades remaining worker nodes
    sequentially.
14. **Post-Validation** — Comprehensive cluster health checks.
15. **Completion** — Updates manifest and displays summary.

!!! important

    - BSS (Boot Script Service) and cloud-init configurations are updated for
      ALL nodes in their respective groups (control planes and workers).
    - Only the first control plane and first worker are rebooted during the
      upgrade to verify the new boot configuration.
    - Remaining nodes are NOT rebooted — they continue running with the
      upgraded software and can be rebooted at any time post successful upgrade.
    - All worker nodes are upgraded sequentially (one at a time) to ensure
      cluster stability.

**Primary Status File**

The K8s upgrade status is tracked at
`<K8s_NFS_mount_point>/upgrade/upgrade_status.yml`.

The mount point is defined in your `storage_config.yml` file. Look for the NFS
mount entry where `name: "nfs_k8s"` and the `mount_point` field shows the path.

```yaml title="Example: storage_config.yml"
mounts:
  - name: "nfs_k8s"
    source: "172.16.107.121:/mnt/share/omnia_k8s"
    mount_point: "/opt/omnia/k8s_mount"   # This is your K8s NFS mount point
    fs_type: "nfs"
    mnt_opts: "nosuid,rw,sync,hard,intr"
    mount_on_oim: true
    functional_group_prefix: ["service_kube"]
```

In this example, the upgrade status file would be located at:

```text title="Example"
/opt/omnia/k8s_mount/upgrade/upgrade_status.yml
```

!!! note

    The mount point path may be different in your environment. Always check
    your `storage_config.yml` file (located at
    `/opt/omnia/input/project_default/storage_config.yml`) to find the exact
    path configured for your K8s NFS storage.

!!! note

    1. Run the `upgrade.yml` playbook from the `/omnia/upgrade` directory so
       that logs are captured in
       `/opt/omnia/log/core/playbooks/upgrade.log`.
    2. If upgrade fails, check the cluster is healthy, fix issues if any and
       rerun the `upgrade.yml` playbook.

## Telemetry Upgrade

!!! note

    The telemetry upgrade is automatically executed as part of
    [Phase 2: Execute Upgrade](#phase-2-execute-upgrade). The upgrade
    orchestrator processes the `telemetry` component in the correct order
    (after Kubernetes and before Slurm) and handles all validation and status
    tracking automatically.

The telemetry upgrade process upgrades telemetry components to their 2.2
versions while ensuring minimal disruption to metric collection and monitoring
services.

**Upgrade Process**

The telemetry upgrade automatically performs the following operations:

1. **Component Detection** — Identifies which telemetry components are
   currently deployed in the cluster.
2. **Upgrade Path Determination** — Determines the appropriate upgrade
   procedure for each detected component.
3. **Component-Specific Upgrade** — Executes the upgrade procedure for each
   telemetry component.
4. **Validation** — Verifies successful upgrade and pod readiness before
   proceeding.

**Post-Upgrade Validation**

After the telemetry upgrade completes, the playbook performs the following
validation steps:

1. Retrieves the status of all telemetry pods in the telemetry namespace.
2. Waits for all pods to reach `Running` or `Completed` state (60 retries x
   15 seconds per retry).
3. Displays the final pod readiness status.
4. Updates the upgrade manifest with `completed` status.

## Slurm Upgrade

!!! note

    The Slurm upgrade is automatically executed as part of
    [Phase 2: Execute Upgrade](#phase-2-execute-upgrade). The upgrade
    orchestrator processes the `slurm` component in the correct order (after
    `telemetry`) and handles all validation and status tracking automatically.

The Slurm upgrade workflow updates the cloud-init and BSS configurations on
all Slurm cluster nodes and applies the changes through a coordinated reboot
of the cluster infrastructure. This process ensures that provisioning, node
configuration, and runtime settings are synchronized with the target Omnia
release.

!!! warning

    - **Compatibility**: Slurm upgrade may face issues if the cluster is not on
      Slurm version 25.05.2. Ensure the version verification in the
      [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section passes before proceeding with
      the upgrade.
    - **Version Pinning**: EPEL repositories now ship Slurm 26.x packages,
      which conflicts with the Slurm 25.05.2 packages expected by Omnia. If
      the version check in prerequisites fails, apply the Slurm version pinning
      workaround. For detailed instructions, see the
      [Slurm Version Pinning Workaround for Omnia v2.1.0.0](https://omnia.readthedocs.io/en/v2.1.0.0/Troubleshooting/slurm.html#slurm-version-pinning-workaround).
    - All Slurm compute, control, and login nodes are rebooted simultaneously
      during the upgrade process. Ensure that no critical or long-running jobs
      are active before starting the upgrade.
    - Do not modify Slurm node definitions or host mappings in the PXE mapping
      file while the upgrade is in progress.
    - Existing NFS mount configurations from Omnia 2.1 are preserved during
      the upgrade. Do not add, remove, or modify NFS mount points until the
      upgrade has completed successfully.

**Slurm Upgrade Workflow**

During the Slurm upgrade, Omnia performs the following operations:

1. Updates cloud-init configurations for all Slurm functional node groups.
2. Updates BSS configurations used for node provisioning and configuration
   management.
3. Applies the updated configurations to the following node categories:
    - `slurm_control_node`
    - `slurm_node`
    - `login_node`
    - `login_compiler_node`
4. Initiates a coordinated reboot of all Slurm and login nodes.
5. Waits for each node to complete the reboot cycle and restore SSH
   connectivity.
6. Verifies the operational status of Slurm services on each node.
7. Generates a consolidated upgrade status report for all nodes.

**Node Reboot and Validation**

After configuration updates are applied, Omnia initiates a cluster-wide reboot
to activate the new settings.

The reboot workflow includes the following validations:

- A reboot command is issued to all Slurm and login nodes.
- Each node is allowed up to 1200 seconds to complete the reboot process.
- Omnia continuously checks for SSH availability after the reboot.
- Nodes are given up to 60 seconds to re-establish SSH connectivity once
  booting is complete.
- After SSH connectivity is restored, Omnia validates Slurm functionality
  using the `sinfo` command.
- The validation operation is retried automatically to accommodate service
  startup delays.

**Health Checks Performed**

The following checks are performed for every upgraded node:

**Pre-Reboot Validation**

- Verify that the node is reachable before initiating the reboot.
- Confirm that the node is accessible through SSH.

**Post-Reboot Validation**

- Verify successful completion of the reboot operation.
- Confirm restoration of SSH connectivity.
- Validate that Slurm services are running correctly.
- Verify that `sinfo` returns a valid response from the node.

**Upgrade Status Report**

At the end of the upgrade process, Omnia generates a node-level status report
summarizing the outcome for every node in the cluster. The report categorizes
nodes into the following groups:

- **Successful** — The node completed all upgrade stages successfully.
- **Unreachable** — The node was not reachable before the reboot phase.
- **Reboot Failed** — The reboot command could not be executed successfully.
- **SSH Failure** — The node rebooted but did not restore SSH connectivity
  within the allowed timeout period.
- **sinfo Failure** — Slurm services failed to start correctly or did not
  respond to `sinfo` validation checks.

**Post-Upgrade Recommendations**

After a successful upgrade:

- Verify overall cluster health using `sinfo` and `scontrol show nodes`.
- Confirm that all expected compute nodes have returned to the `IDLE` or
  intended operational state.
- Validate NFS accessibility from login and compute nodes.
- Submit a small test job to confirm scheduler functionality.
- Review the generated status report and investigate any nodes reported under
  the Unreachable, Reboot Failed, SSH Failure, or sinfo Failure categories
  before returning the cluster to production use.

## Phase 2: Execute Upgrade

After reviewing the component-specific upgrade details above, run the full
upgrade:

```bash title="Run on: omnia_core container"
cd /omnia/upgrade
ansible-playbook upgrade.yml
```

**aarch64 clusters**: If your PXE mapping file contains aarch64 functional
groups (e.g., `slurm_node_aarch64`), you must pass an inventory file with the
`[admin_aarch64]` group:

```bash title="Run on: omnia_core container"
cd /omnia/upgrade
ansible-playbook upgrade.yml -i <inventory_file>
```

The inventory file must define exactly one ARM admin node under the
`[admin_aarch64]` group. Example inventory:

```ini title="Example: aarch64 inventory file"
[admin_aarch64]
<arm_admin_node_ip_or_hostname>

!!! note

    - The `[admin_aarch64]` group must contain exactly one host. Multiple
      hosts or an empty group will cause the upgrade to fail.
    - The ARM admin node must be accessible via SSH from the OIM host.
    - NFS must be configured on the OIM for aarch64 image building to work.
    - If your cluster has only x86_64 nodes (no aarch64 entries in the PXE
      mapping file), the `-i` option is not required.

## Post-Upgrade Verification

After the upgrade completes, verify the following:

1. Check the upgrade summary displayed at the end of the playbook run.
2. Verify the upgrade manifest:

    ```bash title="Run on: omnia_core container"
    cat /opt/omnia/.data/upgrade_manifest.yml
    ```

3. Confirm all component statuses show `completed` or `skipped`.
4. Validate cluster health:
    - **Kubernetes cluster**: `kubectl get nodes`
    - **Slurm cluster**: `sinfo`
    - **Telemetry**: Verify metrics are being collected
5. If BuildStreaM is enabled, trigger the GitLab pipeline for downstream
   components.
