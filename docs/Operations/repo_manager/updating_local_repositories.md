# Update Local Repositories after Catalog Changes

## Overview

Repo Manager does not monitor the catalog for changes. After adding, updating,
or deleting catalog content, validate the revised catalog, synchronize it, and
regenerate `repo_status.yml`.

Successful content is tracked by exact package identity, so rerunning the
workflow reuses completed content instead of intentionally downloading
everything again.

## Prerequisites

- Pulp is deployed and running.
- `SYSTEM_ADMIN_NIC_IPV4` and `CATALOG_FILE_PATH` are exported.
- The updated catalog remains an existing absolute `.json` file. To select a
  different catalog, follow
  [Select or update the catalog](../../HowTo/main/update_catalog.md).
- Any new RPM repositories or private registries are mapped in
  `repo_manager_config.yml`.

## Procedure

1. Change the catalog with one of the supported catalog operations:

    ~~~bash title="Run on: OIM host"
    cd <OMNIA_SOURCE_PATH>/src/repo_manager/playbooks

    # Add or update packages and groups.
    ansible-playbook repo_manager.yml --tags catalog_add \
      -e "input_file=/absolute/path/to/additions.txt"

    # Or remove package references.
    ansible-playbook repo_manager.yml --tags catalog_delete \
      -e "input_file=/absolute/path/to/removals.txt"
    ~~~

    The delete input lists package keys under their current group:

    ~~~ini
    [openldap_group]
    openldap_clients
    ~~~

    `catalog_delete` removes the package object only when no other group
    references it, and removes an empty group from its functional layers.

2. Validate the catalog and all active mappings:

    ~~~bash title="Run on: OIM host"
    ansible-playbook repo_manager.yml --tags catalog_validate
    ansible-playbook repo_manager.yml --tags precheck
    ~~~

3. Synchronize selected content and regenerate the consumer contract:

    ~~~bash title="Run on: OIM host"
    ansible-playbook repo_manager.yml --tags "download,status"
    ~~~

4. If content was removed from the catalog and must also be deleted from Pulp,
   use the matching selective cleanup target. Review the exact scope before
   confirming:

    ~~~bash title="Run on: OIM host"
    # Exact RPM repository name.
    ansible-playbook repo_manager.yml --tags cleanup_repos \
      -e "cleanup_repos=x86_64_rhel_10.0_epel"

    # Exact container tag; sibling tags remain.
    ansible-playbook repo_manager.yml --tags cleanup_repos \
      -e "cleanup_containers=registry.example.com/team/image:v1"
    ~~~

    Selective cleanup invalidates the old `repo_status.yml`. Run
    `--tags "download,status"` afterward to restore still-required catalog
    content and publish current output.

## Verification

Inspect the current context summary, package state, and consumer output:

~~~text
<REPO_MANAGER_DATA_PATH>/log/<os>/catalog_execution_summary.yml
<REPO_MANAGER_DATA_PATH>/log/<os>/<version>/<architecture>/<group>/status.csv
<REPO_MANAGER_DATA_PATH>/output/<project>/repo_status.yml
~~~

Confirm every selected context completed successfully and
`repo_status.yml` reports `overall_status: success` before starting an image
build.

## Next steps

- [Build Cluster Images](../../HowTo/image_build_manager/build_images.md).
- [Resynchronize Local Repositories](local_repository_resync.md) when the goal
  is to check existing RPM remotes for upstream changes.
- [Configure Catalog Content](../../HowTo/repo_manager/adding_additional_packages.md).

## Troubleshooting

- **The changed package is not processed**: Confirm the package is reachable
  through a group and functional layer, and that its source matches the active
  version and architecture.
- **A later OS version remains pending**: Repo Manager processes contexts in
  numeric order and stops after a failed context. Fix the first failed version
  and rerun `download,status`.
- **Deleted catalog content still exists in Pulp**: Catalog deletion changes
  selection; it does not perform Pulp cleanup. Run a reviewed selective cleanup.
- **`repo_status.yml` is absent after cleanup**: This is intentional. Run
  `download,status` to synchronize the remaining catalog and regenerate it.
