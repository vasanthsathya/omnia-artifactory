# Apptainer


Apptainer pulls the container images from configured container registries on
all cluster nodes. The method used to retrieve an image depends on the system
registry configuration and image availability.

## Overview


Always start with the standard Apptainer pull command. Additional methods
should only be used when required.

The general Apptainer pull command is the default command to pull container
images:

```bash title="Run on: compute node"
apptainer pull \
  --name <image_name>.sif \
  --dir <image_directory> \
  --tmpdir <temporary_directory> \
  docker://<registry>/<repository>:<tag>
```

!!! note

    - `--dir` specifies the output directory for the final `.sif` image.
    - `--tmpdir` specifies the temporary working directory used during the pull.
    - Both directories should be located on an **NFS-backed filesystem** to avoid
      failures due to limited local disk space.


## Prerequisites


- Apptainer is installed on compute nodes.
- NFS shared storage is configured (see [Configure Mounts](configure_storage.md)).
- Verify Apptainer is installed:

   ```bash title="Run on: compute node"
   apptainer --version
   ```

## Procedure
### Method 1: Standard Image Pull (Pulp-Integrated and Preferred)


1. **Create the directory** used for both image storage and temporary files.
   This directory must be on an NFS-backed filesystem:

    ```bash title="Run on: compute node"
    mkdir -p /hpc_tools/container_images
    ```


2. **Pull the image** using the standard Apptainer workflow. This method
   automatically leverages Pulp when available and requires no changes to
   user behavior:

    ```bash title="Run on: compute node"
    apptainer pull \
    --name ubuntu_22.04.sif \
    --dir /hpc_tools/container_images \
    --tmpdir /hpc_tools/container_images \
    docker://docker.io/library/ubuntu:22.04
    ```


   **Behavior:** Registry mirror behavior is controlled by configuration files
   under `/etc/containers/registries.conf.d/`. When a Pulp registry mirror is
   configured and the image is present, the pull is transparently served from
   Pulp.

   In environments where Pulp usage is required and the image is known to
   exist, the Pulp registry may be specified explicitly:

   ```
   docker://<pulp-registry>/<namespace>/ubuntu:22.04
   ```

   Replace `<pulp-registry>` and `<namespace>` with site-specific values.


### Method 2: Pulling an Image Directly from the Internet (Exception Only)


!!! warning

    - Use this method only if: A Pulp registry mirror is configured, and The image is not available in Pulp or the mirror is unavailable.
    - Administrative privileges are required. Do not delete the configuration — disable it temporarily.


1. **Temporarily disable** the container registry configuration that enforces
   mirroring to Pulp. This configuration is typically located under:

    ```
    /etc/containers/registries.conf.d/
    ```


2. **Pull the image** directly from the public registry. Use the same
   NFS-backed directory for both image storage and temporary files:

    ```bash title="Run on: compute node"
    apptainer pull --disable-cache \
    --name ubuntu_22.04.sif \
    --dir /hpc_tools/container_images \
    --tmpdir /hpc_tools/container_images \
    docker://docker.io/library/ubuntu:22.04
   ```


## Verification


1. **Verify the SIF image** was downloaded successfully:

    ```bash title="Run on: compute node"
    ls -lh /hpc_tools/container_images/ubuntu_22.04.sif
    apptainer inspect /hpc_tools/container_images/ubuntu_22.04.sif
    ```


!!! note

    After pulling directly from the internet, restore the registry mirror configuration so that future pulls again route through Pulp.

    For detailed guidance on using Apptainer and NVIDIA HPC Benchmarks, refer to the [Apptainer User Documentation](https://apptainer.org/docs/user/main/).


## Next steps

- [Configure Catalog Content](../repo_manager/adding_additional_packages.md)
  -- Add software or container content to the synchronized catalog.

## Troubleshooting

- **Apptainer command not found**: Verify that the selected catalog includes
  the `apptainer` package and that Repo Manager, Image Build Manager, and
  Orchestrator provisioning completed successfully.
- **Container image pull fails**: Confirm network connectivity and that the container registry is accessible from the compute node.
